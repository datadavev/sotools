Overview
--------

Dates of creation and modification are fundamental properties of a dataset. For consumers such as DataONE, modification
dates are used to determine if cached copies of content are stale and so should be updated. This document describes
how creation and modification dates are retrieved from ``SO:Dataset`` resources exposed through a web publishing
pattern.
